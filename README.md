# Ruby_AI
## Introduction
This project aims to solve a rubiks cube using deep q-learning. We have been working with a 2x2 rubiks cube, since it contains fewer states. And we are only interested in this as a "proof of concept kind" of project

## How to run
There are a number of parameters the user can adjust in the *config.ini* file. Here is a quickstart guide. To start training a network to solve cubes, go the config.ini file and make sure that the variable *train* is set to *True*. To test a network, set *test* to *True* and *train* to *false*.
